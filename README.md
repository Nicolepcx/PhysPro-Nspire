# PhysPro for Nspire
## Description
Solves multiple physics equations and perforoms routine physics-related calculations. I made it for my IB Physics course in high school, and I am updating it as I learn new formulas. Almost all of the code is from EEPro-for-Nspire by Jim Bauwens and Adrien Bertrand. The only requirement to run the program is  to have Nspire OS â‰¥ 3.0. You can find the latest updates [here](http://education.ti.com).
